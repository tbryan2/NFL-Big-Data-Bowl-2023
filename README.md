# NFL-Big-Data-Bowl-2023

## Instructions

[Competition Instructions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2023/overview)

### Goal of the Competition

The National Football League (NFL) is back with another Big Data Bowl, where contestants use Next Gen Stats player tracking data to generate actionable, creative, and novel stats. Previous iterations have considered running backs, defensive backs, and special teams, and have generated metrics that have been used on television and by NFL teams. In this year’s competition, you’ll have more subtle performances to consider—and potentially more players to measure.

### 2023 Theme: Linemen on Pass Plays

Quarterbacks may get the glory, but some of the most important work takes place a few feet in front of them. The offensive line protects the passer, providing precious seconds to find receivers downfield. At the same time, the opposing team’s defensive line attempts to find a disruptive path. If a defender sneaks through, it can mean a sack, a blocked pass, or even a turnover. Some of the game’s most important plays happen on the line and this competition examines the data behind the hardest workers in football.

In this competition, you’ll have access to the NFL’s Next Gen Stats data, including player tracking, play, game, and player information, as well as Pro Football Focus (PFF) scouting data for 2021 passing plays (Weeks 1-8 of the NFL season). You’ll create new metrics and stats for America's most popular sports league. Notebook submissions will be scored based on five components: innovation, accuracy, relevance, clarity, and data visualization.

Winners will be invited to present their results to the NFL, where one competition team will receive an additional prize. The most useful new metrics or analysis could be also used by NFL teams to evaluate their offensive and defensive lines.

## Evaluation

### Overview

Your challenge is to generate actionable, practical, and novel insights from player tracking data that corresponds to linemen performance on passing plays.

Participants will select one of three tracks in which to submit.

- _Undergraduate track._ This is open only to groups or individuals composed entirely of undergraduate students. Verification may be required to prove eligibility.
- _Metric track._ Create a metric to assess performance and/or strategy. This can be focused on offensive or defensive players, and on teams or individuals.
- _Coaching presentation track._ The goal of this track is to analyze and present data in a submission designed for coaches. We encourage participants interested in this track to partner with a coach (or current/former player), though that is not required.
All submissions must explicitly state which track they are submitting to. Participants may not submit to more than one track.

### Scoring

An entry to the competition consists of a Notebook submission that is evaluated on the following five components, where 0 is the low score and 10 is the high score. Submissions will be judged based on how well they address:

### Innovation:

Are the proposed findings actionable?
Is this a way of looking at tracking data that is novel?
Is this project creative?
Accuracy:

Is the work correct?
Are claims backed up by data?
Are the statistical models appropriate given the data?
Relevance:

Would NFL teams (or the league office) be able to use these results on a week-to-week basis?
Does the analysis account for variables that make football data complex?
Clarity:

Evaluate the writing with respect to how clear the writer(s) make findings.
Data visualization/tables:

Are the charts and tables provided accessible, interesting, visually appealing, and accurate?
Judges will consist of analytics staffers that are working for either (i) NFL headquarters, (ii) the 32 NFL teams, or (iii) player tracking vendors that work with NFL teams. Scores will be averaged so that each of the components above are weighed equally.

The top eight scoring papers will be selected as finalists (at least two per track)

### Notebook requirements

Notebooks should consist of no more than 2,000 words and no more than 10 tables/figures. Submissions will not be penalized for any number of words or figures under this limit. Participants are encouraged to show statistical code if it helps readers better understand their analyses; most, if not all code, however, should be hidden in the Appendix.

All notebooks submitted must be made public on or before the submission deadline to be eligible. If submitting as a team, all team members must be listed as collaborators on all notebooks submitted.

Any notebook that does not use the player tracking data will not be scored.
